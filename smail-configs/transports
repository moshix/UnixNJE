# @(#)samples/generic/transports	1.11 9/6/92 04:41:55

# This file defines the configuration of the transport subsystem as
# compiled into the smail binary.  By modifying the source files
# conf/EDITME, src/config.h or src/default.c the actual internal
# configuration can be changed.  Thus, this should be matched up
# against thes files before assuming this is completely correct.
#
# If a run-time transports file is created, then its entries will
# complement or replace the compiled-in transport entries.  Thus,
# contrary to use of the routers and directors files, you do not need
# to copy and localize this file in order to add new transports.
#
#
# IMPORTANT FOR INTERNET USERS
#
# The smtp, uucp_zone_smtp, inet_zone_smtp, and local_smtp transports
# should be configured to use the DNS for finding MX and A records,
# if the host was not resolved by the bind version of the inet_hosts
# router.  To configure this, uncomment the use_bind attributes on
# the various tcpsmtp-based transport definitions.
#
#
# IMPORTANT FOR SCO UNIX SYSTEMS
#
# Recent SCO UNIX systems use the MMDF file format.  If you wish to
# have smail generate this format, then comment out the unix_from_hack
# and the first suffix lines, in the "local" and "file" transports,
# and uncomment all lines that are commented with "MMDF mailbox format".
#
#
# IMPORTANT FOR SYSTEM V RELEASE 4 USERS
#
# The SVR4 mailx expects to find Content-Length header fields on
# messages.  If such a header is not found (or if a remote site
# supplies an incorrect Content-Length header), then mailx may split
# your mailbox file into messages at inappropriate boundaries.  To
# add a Content-Length field to messages appended to your mailbox
# files, and sent to shell-command or file addresses, uncomment all
# attributes that are indicated with "SVR4 mailbox format".  This
# will also ensure that you have a "Content-Type" field, defaulting
# the content type to "text".
#
# You will likely also wish to uncomment unix_from_hack from the
# local, pipe, and file transports, since prepending > to lines
# starting with From is not necessary with this the SVR4 mailbox
# format.  You can also comment out the suffix="\n" lines in the
# local, and file transports, since a blank line is not required
# between messages for the SVR4 mailbox format.
#
#
# IMPORTANT FOR USE WITH HoneyDanBer UUCP
#
# Systems with HoneyDanBer UUCP (for example, System V Release 4)
# can invoke uux with -a$sender -g$grade to cause UUCP errors to
# be mailed to the message sender, and to alter UUCP queue priorities
# based on Precedence header fields.  For SVR4, you should add the
# following to your /etc/uucp/Grades file:
#
#	9	9	Any	User	Any
#	A	A	Any	User	Any
#	C	C	Any	User	Any
#	a	a	Any	User	Any
#	n	n	Any	User	Any
#
# This is because the SVR4 HDB UUCP uses long message grade names
# on the uux command line, which are not supported by Smail.
#
#
# HANDLING TRANSIENT UUCP FAILURES
#
# Many systems seem to get failures from uux from time to time.  I
# guess this is load related.  Smail normally returns bounce messages
# in such situations.  However, generating a bounce message can be
# annoying if the failures are truly transient.
#
# The only way to handle this, if you encounter this often, is to
# make sure that your UUCP configuration doesn't have any conflicts
# with your smail configuration (which implies that uux should never
# fail for configuration-related errors).  Then, uncomment the
# defer_child_errors attribute in the various uux-based transports
# defined in this file.  This will cause smail to retry (at a later
# time) any failures encountered by executing uux.


# local - deliver mail to local users

# By default, smail will append directly to user mailbox files.

# local - an alternate local transport that calls on /bin/lmail
#
# Some systems have special local conventions for mail delivery that
# smail does not understand.  Such conventions may include adding
# special headers, or may include particular locking conventions.  For
# such systems, smail can use a system-provided program for delivery
# to user mailbox files.  On most systems, the /bin/mail program will
# perform mail delivery according to local conventions.  However,
# smail will often require that /bin/mail be replaced with a program
# that calls out to smail to perform delivery.  By convention, the
# original /bin/mail program should be saved to /bin/lmail.
#
# It may be necessary to modify this entry to operate within your
# local conventions.

# local_* - local forms for all of the remote transport entries
#
# Local format transports are useful when transferring mail messsages
# within coordinated networks that all run Smail3.1.  When the local
# attribute is enabled for a transport that delivers messages to a
# remote machine, any local addresses in the header or envelope of the
# message are left as local-format addresses, and the sender is left
# as a local login name.
#
# This convention for message tranfers allows local networks to be
# hidden by the common mail users and by users external to the
# network.  Messages transferred to remote nodes in the network will
# appear as though they originated on the receiving node.  Messages
# that eventually leave the network (and are thus delivered by a
# transport that does not have the local attribute set) will be
# transformed into remote-format messages, with qualified domain names
# for all local-format addresses.
#
# This can be very convenient for networks that have a central mail
# processor that handles all mailing lists and forwarding for the
# network, and where user names are kept coordinated throughout the
# network.
