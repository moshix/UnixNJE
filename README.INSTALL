	Guide to install FUNET-NJE software into UNIX systems.

		by Matti Aarnio <mea@nic.funet.fi>


		READ THE   README.FUNET   FILE!
		READ THE  funetnje.info / funetnje.ps  DOCUMENT!

	The configuration and installation is covered on the
	funetnje.info/funetnje.ps -document, this file is from
	the older era...



	This version of software does not support any kind of
	BISYNC-adapters available for various systems.   Mainly
	because I didn't have such interface available for testing...

	However:  TCP-IP interface works well (one of rare features
	that are ALMOAST identical among various UNIXes).


	When starting to do installation, you must determine few
	system dependent features:


In  Makefile:

	Well, dependencies should be all right, some external defines
	and route + install phases propably need an update.

	Usage of  `ranlib'  depends upon your system, same with  `install'

	Choise of group-name used on client-program installation.

In  detach.c:

	See & try which setup works best.  Quite well documented in there.



		CONFIGURING SYSTEM:


	Create a new group for FUNET-NJE internal use, say `bitnet'.
	Decide and create your BITNET spool directory:
		/usr/spool/bitnet
	set its protection to be 2775 (or 2770), group-write is
	needed.  Set its group to be abovementioned `bitnet'.
	(Mode 2xxx attempts to do BSD directory semantics on group
	 inheritance)

	Decide where you put your user spool directories, exaple:
		/var/spool/bitspool
	However HAVE THEM ON SAME PHYSICAL DEVICE so that rename(2)
	(or rename(3)) can be used successfully to place files into
	there.  Directory can have protection 111, or 555.  Nobody
	(but root) need to have write-permission there.


	Programs used for sending BITNET files are configured to
	do a set-gid operation, and then write file to be spooled
	into the `QUEUE' directory, and finally sending a submission
	signal to the transporter.
