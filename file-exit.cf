#  FILE-EXIT.CF -- Configure file handling on FUNET-NJE
#
# Rule for spool disposition path, defines also system default
# user spool directory for those who don't have specially set
# something else.
# Possibilities:	~/bitspool  -- real user's only! (~/ == users home)
#			/usr/path/path/ -- append 'touser' as subdir,
#					    it is spool dir.
#					   Valid for Exits and real users.
#			/usr/path/path	-- explicite directory.
#			/dev/null	-- explicite file (special case).
#	When directory isn't present, it is built from upmost present level
#	down to users bottommost level hmm...
#   Question about ownership of directory/files...
#     Real users:  real protections, programs start with setuid() user.
#	  Exit users:  POSTMAST	 (exits start as root anyway.)
#	  Exited reals: real protections, programs start with setuid() user.

Spool-Dir:	/var/spool/bitspool/
Postmast-Dir:	/var/spool/bitspool/POSTMAST

# Now list of things to match and then what to do
# To do keywords:	DISCARD to /dev/null.
#			KEEP	just so.  Into default or given spool.
#			NOTIFY	send an NJE message to someone.
#			RUN	starts arbitary program with arbitary
#				arguments telling about file location
#				and its properties.
#				If fails, well..

# Defining  SpoolDir  which shall not be attached ToUser must not be done
