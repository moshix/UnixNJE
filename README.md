NJE for *nix
=============



This NJE repo is is the third incarnation of the Hebrew University of Jersualem NJE protocol for UNIX and VMS. 

In this new version, it's been made to compile cleanly on Linux, BSD (including latest Macos!) 

You will need to ask to peer with somebody on HNET to use this protocol. Contact me if you have a 24/7 Linux server and you want to peer with my HNET main node MOSHIX running VM/370 RSCS. 

All the main commands work with NJE



INSTALL
------

get repo to your Linux/BSD/Macos (anything from the last 6-7 years should work)

then type "make" and watch it compile

Running It
----------

To execute it you need sudo privileges, or need to be root. 

More detals to follow here soon




Enjoy
