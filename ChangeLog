Fri Mar 22 13:48:30 1996  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* libsendcmd.c, unix.c:
	    Even more relaxed approach on parametrizing
	    the CMDMAILBOX -- now allows SOCK/FIFO/UDP
	    with fairly flexible (in regards of spaces)
	    syntax..

Mon Nov 13 17:48:52 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* libsendcmd.c, unix.c:
	    A bit more relaxed approach on parametrizing
	    CMDMAILBOX config parameter (FIFO/SOCKET case)

	* file_queue.c:
	    Do RSCS-accounting on locally sent files, that
	    wind up to local recipients

	* unix_brcst.c:
	    Re-enter the SysVR4 UTMP weirdos..  Now fixed ?

Fri Aug 25 09:02:55 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* mailify.c:
	    Handling error-messages (where "MAIL FROM:" address
	    is "<>", that is, empty) was done improperly.  Now
	    it does flag input as from "channel error" in that
	    case.

Mon Jul 24 14:29:59 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* bmail.c, sendfile.c:
	    Sometimes   mktemp()  fails when there are a LOT of
	    files being sent at the same time.  Changed now to
	    more classical  ".MaiL.%05d"-format with  getpid()
	    result as integer data..

Wed Jun 21 22:42:39 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* unix_brcst.c, nmr_unix.c:
	    Ok, more than __linux__ is needed to know which
	    machines have <utmp.h> containing extended flags.
	    Now we test  "DEAD_PROCESS" pre-processor define,
	    which existence (propably) will correlate with
	    the existence of utmp's field  ut_type.
	    (SysVr4 feature, I think.)

Mon Jun 19 15:17:55 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* send.c, sendfile.c, bmail.c:
	    Some additional tests to trap various forms of bad
	    addresses -- accepts only  user@node format with
	    no '.' in the address, nor either component longer
	    than 8 chars.

	* nmr.c:
	    Made sure not to overwrite allocated string spaces on
	    Msg-queue entry.  (Did cause a crash with it..)

Tue Jun 13 09:13:18 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* qrdr.c:
	    Collect directory browsing results to an array at first,
	    then qsort() it with the time-stamp, and finally display
	    them in order. (Latest last)
	    (This is something what Gerald Hanush asked for.)

Mon Jun 12 22:44:00 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* file_queue.c:
	    Apparently OSF/1 pipe() return value is the first
	    fd, not "0", when it succeeds.  Nice thing - and not..
	    Altered the test to see if it returns a value under
	    zero, or something positive.  When the return is
	    positive (zero, or larger), fork() and run in
	    child-mode.

	    If a child_pipe exists already ( >= 0 ), close
	    it and mark the new one for processing.

	* libreadcfg.c, read_config, libsendcmd.c, unix.c:
	    Rewrote things so that now the used CMDMAILBOX
	    transport method is chosen at runtime:

	    CMDMAILBOX  F  /path/to/.cmdfifo
	    CMDMAILBOX  f  /path/to/.cmdfifo
	    CMDMAILBOX  S  /path/to/.cmdsocket
	    CMDMAILBOX  U  127.0.0.2 175	# UDP port

	    The "f" is FIFO which is closed, and reopened
	    every time one command is pulled in.

Sun Jun 11 03:12:06 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* namesparser.c:
	    Noticed that the data parsing stopped at first ":",
	    which caused premature breaks; observe following entry
	    from BITEARN.NODES -file:
	    	:remark1.BASE(9501) 00/00/00 00:00:00

	* libreadcfg.c, read_config.c, libsendcmd.c, unix.c:
	   Amended "CMDMAILBOX"-data to contain port-number in
	   case UDP-format is used. (That is, have two tokens.)
	   Default value for the port-number is 175.

	* unix_tcp.c read_passive_tcp_connection():
	   Noticed that a case when a socket exists, and a new
	   connection is attempted is handled improperly. The
	   old socket-fd was FORGOTTEN!  Now it NAKs the connection
	   attempt with a complaint that there already is a connection
	   in there...

	   Things will progress from such a situation usually by
	   detecting a closure on the existing stream, but better
	   not to rush ahead of things.

	* bmail.c:
	   Accept "-u" only when calling the program from uids 0 or 1
	   (root and daemon in most common cases -- for BSD-sendmail
	    which wants  bmail executable with protection 2111 (user X,
	    group NJEGRP) )

Sat Jun 10 05:18:27 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* Makefile, consts.h, prototypes.h, recv_file.c, io.c,
	  send_file.c, unix.c, protocol.c, unix_tcp.c:

	    - Found one uninitialized pointer, which apparently
	      caused mystic data-structure corruptions (on timer
	      subsystem)

	    - Made mandatory (well, with disabling options) to
	      use NBSTREAM, USE_XMIT_QUEUE, and USE_SOCKOPT.
	      (in consts.h, see also  Makefile's  comments!)

	    - Use  F_WAIT_V_A_BIT  to flag if there is any reason
	      for NOT to send out data at the moment, and instead
	      quit from within  handle_ack()..
	      The F_WAIT_V_A_BIT is set when new data is sent to
	      outbound buffer (primary one, or XMIT QUEUE).
	      The bit is cleared when pending writer finishes
	      with success status.  When the pending-writer is
	      called from  poll_sockets(), immediately after it
	      the  dequeue_xmit_queue() is called, and if there
	      is something, it can cause F_WAIT_V_A_BIT to be
	      set again..)

	    - If the XMIT_QUEUE ever runs out of space, it abort()s!

	    - Tested the beast by sending 80 or so smallish files both
	      ways over the link.  Such setup caused previously link
	      corruption..  Actually the critical phase is when there
	      are flowing NJE headers/trailer, bare data sending works
	      just fine, but when a file ends, EOF block needs an ack
	      to be sent, and unless there the care is used, all
	      queues will overflow..

Thu Jun  8 15:48:14 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* namesfilter.c:
	    New option: "-netsoft" to list node software fields.

	* funetnje.texinfo:
	    Some additional chapters

	* unix_tcp.c:
	    FINALLY realized why sometimes file sending from
	    queue does not start on some lines.  Reason was
	    that PASSIVE VMNET open didn't clear all multi-
	    stream bookkeeping bits -> all lines were "in use",
	    when line started often enough in passive mode :-(
	    (That is, on PASSIVE start, if previous shutdown
	     had happened with all streams sending something..)

	* protocol.c, consts.h, unix.c, unix_tcp.c, io.c:
	    Serious Hacking -- NBSTREAM does not work without
	    USE_XMIT_QUEUE - had to implement it properly.

	* unix_brdcst.c, nmr_unix.c:
	    Linux feature(s) of UTMP usage caused some surprises,
	    now created necessary "#ifdef __linux__" "fix".

Tue Jun  6 12:28:31 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* unix_tcp.c, protocol.c:
	    Couple more NBSTREAM tests so that we won't run over ourselves
	    when transmiting on a stream.

	* file_queue.c, io.c:
	    Revised slightly the queue handling - when restarting a link,
	    ALWAYS tear apart the current state.
	    ("debug rescan" must not destroy the current queue state,
	     however genuine link restart can do it - while requeueing.)

	* nmr.c, io.c, consts.h:
	    Requeue NMR-messages ("struct MESSAGE" changed a bit)
	    when a link restarts.

Wed May 24 13:19:13 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* unix.c, unix_tcp.c, protocol.c, prototypes.h:
	    Still more revisions into NBSTREAM processing code,
	    also tried to improve sending speed, which now clocks
	    to 50kB/s or better.. ( Previously 30kB/s was tops
	    with 0.25 sec timeout on select(), now select timeout
	    is changed to 1.0 sec :-)  )

Thu May 18 02:51:44 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* sendfile.c:
	    Revised target-address processing..

	* nmr.c, send.c:
	    Consider only codes below ASCII ' ' (SPACE) to be bad on message
	    transmission. -- Lets 8-bit ISO-Latin chars go thru as is...

	* ebcdic.h, ebcdicinv.c:
	    Made a 1:1 mapping in between ASCII and EBCDIC in true
	    JNET fashion (likely exactly same table as they have..)

Mon Apr 24 08:48:51 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* sendfile.c:
	    A bit stricter processing of target address - to ensure that
	    it follows the 8+8 limits of NJE..

	* transfer.c:
	    Check that the file-path given to us is absolute -- that is,
	    it starts with "/".

	* consts.h, io.c vmnet_monitor():
	    "VMNET MONITOR" probe interval changed to 60 seconds,
	    and full timeout to 4*60 seconds.
	    Now ONE slow-responding case (like temporary connectivity
	    breakdown) won't break the link.

Fri Apr 21 11:23:23 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* unix.c, util.c:
	    A bit more processing when the emulator gets SIGHUP:
		- close (and open) route table
		- close (and open) RSCS accounting file
		- close (open is implicitic) Spoolid cache
		- re-read File-Exits
		- re-read Msg-Exits
		- close (and open) logfile.

	* consts.h, unix_tcp.c, unix.c:
	    Under some unclear conditions the InBuffer and/or XmitBuffer
	    appeared to be overfull -> data following it becomes over-
	    written causing all kinds of havock...  Re-arranged buffers
	    so that such overwrite corrupts (at first) dataset-headers,
	    and only then goes out to next buffer in chain..
	    There used to be important length counters following
	    those buffers...

	* unix_tcp.c, io.c, unix.c:
	    Still more fixes to NBSTREAM -- under some conditions
	    the  WritePending  was left set, and clearing it
	    at link activation was not taken care off..
	    ( NBSTREAM implies (fully) NBCONNECT, on one case the
	      NBCONNECT wasn't happening -> active connect failed.. )

	    Odd startup problems turned out to be non-resets of
	    InBCB and OutBCB variables when the link starts.
	    (Reset to zero at link init is a protocol requirement!)

Thu Apr 20 12:47:07 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* zmailer-configs/, smail-configs/, sendmail-configs/:
	    New subdirectories with SOME support files
	    for each mailer.

	* bintree.c:
	    Changed ``bintree-db''-file header structure (radically)
	    Now it contains couple signature-like objects, which
	    are used to see if the file is correct for the machine
	    where it is run.

	* util.c:
	    Decided that having spoolid-cache in machine-independent
	    format is not 1) easy, 2) necessary.

Wed Apr 19 22:11:35 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* file_queue.c, io.c:
	    Looked over the  Line->QueuedFiles & Line->QueuedFilesWaiting
	    variables usages.

	* io.c vmnet_monitor(), unix.c, prototypes.h, consts.h:
	    NBSTREAM requires active monitor.  Implemented by
	    sending NMR-cmd "CPQ TIME" to each ACTIVE link-peer.
	    If the link does not return anything (`Line->InAge'
	    timestamp is updated at each socket read) within TWO
	    T_VMNET_INTERVALs, link is determined dead, and
	    ``restart_channel(i)'' is called.

	    Query is sent from VMNET@HOSTNAME userid, and therefore
	    msg-exit.cf MUST be configured to process it...  Well,
	    reply is MSG from system, and thus undeliverability will
	    not cause msg-ping-pong, but purity is a nice goal.

	* unix_tcp.c, unix.c, protocol.c, Makefile:
	    NBSTREAM -- FINALLY done right!

Tue Apr 18 08:18:30 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* unix_tcp.c:
	    Nth attempt to get the ENQUIRE correct - now finally, it
	    is no SYN+NAK, nor SYN+ENQ; it is SOH+ENQ...

	* util.c:
	    `spoolid'-db routines needed machine-byte-order INDEPENDENT format
	    (The RARE case of moving server from one host to another bite me..)

	* protocol.c restart_channel():
	    Removed  init_link_state() -call, which was VERY harmfull,
	    though its effects were very indirect indeed...

	    Added several tests of:  ``Line->state != ACTIVE''
	    into the main NJE-protocol switch-statement.
	    ( When the block-write fails, it is correct to quit, and not
	      to try to send (again) to a closed socket.. -> SIGSEGV )

	* __fopen.c:
	    Changed the "__"-prefix of __fopen() et.al. to be "_nje_",
	    because apparently the OSF/1 does have __fdopen() in its
	    libraries..

	* sendfile.c:
	    Processing of "-asa" -printouts decremented "maxlen"
	    at wrong place -- when the file was longer than 136
	    lines, the system started to collapse..

Thu Apr 13 11:40:59 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi>

	* namesfilter.c, netinit.sh:
	    With some reading of  NEWTAGS DESCRIPT (available from your
	    nearest NETSERV), determined the CORRECT way to pick mailer
	    entries, and rewrote the "netinit.sh" to automate (in smarter
	    way) the BITNET related databases.  (Thanks to Eric Thomas.)

Wed Apr 12 09:00:02 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@nic.funet.fi> ( & Paul E Bryant )

	* send_file.c:
	    When creating a NetworkJobHeader, the NDHGXEQ[UN] -fields
	    get SENDERs value for SYSOUTs, but DESTINATION for SYSINs!

	    With help of Eric Thomas discovered that  NDHVDIST was
	    produced with garbage contents (his LMAIL mailer is picky,
	    when it comes to NJE data...).  Reason:  upperstr() on
	    a buffer containing (at that point) EBCDIC data :-(

Fri Mar 24 15:02:45 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@hamsterix.funet.fi>

	* unix_files.c, unix.c, io.c, file_queue.c, consts.h:
	    Added "ToAddr" into the queue-entry information thus
	    making it unnecessary to re-scan spool files when
	    some event causes full queue re-scan.. -- like
	    state-change of a link..

Fri Mar 24 11:22:18 1995  Paul E Bryant <peb@mailbox.rl.ac.uk>

	* njeroutes.c main():
	    Copying arguments from argv[] to string buffers must
	    use  strncpy(), NOT memcpy()!

	* bmail.c:
	    Define a #define MAILERNAME which can be set on Makefile
	    to define some other "userid", which sends email.  Default
	    is "MAILER".

	    Header-folding code for narrow (normal) BSMTP-PUNCH mode.

Thu Mar 23 15:20:12 1995  Matti Aarnio  <mea@hamsterix.funet.fi>

	* logger.c, namesfilter.c, headers.h, consts.h, detach.c, util.c,
	  prototypes.h, unix.c, unix_brdcst.c, unix_tcp.c, liblstr.c, Makefile:
	    "Minor" porting job to get the thing to compile on OSF/1 v3.2.
	    (Completed in 30 minutes -- that's why I say "minor" :) )

	    The most important thing was to teach it not to assume that
	    "long" or "unsigned long" mean anything -- rather they do not
	    mean 32-bit integers on 64-bit alphas...  Also teached it to
	    treat TIME specially -- time_t is for it.

	    Used "SunOS-4.1.3+GCC" compile switches to compile it on DEC AXP..

Tue Jan 10 16:32:15 1995  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* io.c:
	    When doing  init_link_state(),  do remember also
	    to close (possibly) open sockets so that a case of
	    write-failure on a link will not cause accumulation
	    of the connected sockets.

Fri Nov 25 15:44:14 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* unix_files.c:
	    More care on   chown(2)  calls.
	    Now it should not  chown to root the user's spool
	    directory, when SENDING a file.

Wed Oct  5 15:58:00 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* mailify.c:
	    Finally integrated it with Zmailer and TESTED.
	    (Full functionality only for BSMTP, NETDATA, and
	     plain PUNCH file..)

	* libreceive.c, nmr.c, unix_tcp.c, libndfuncs.c, bintree.c:
	    Various complaints from SunOS 4.x 'cc', the bundled
	    compiler..

Tue Sep 27 09:39:36 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* namesparser.c, namesfilter.c: NEW
	    A filter utility for producing Zmailer's  routes.bitnet
	    table -- and also  Smail's..

	* funetnje.texinfo:
	    Major editing, filled in about half of what was missing
	    (chaptervice), added chapters about support, and history..
	    Still some commands need documentation, and the internal
	    stuff is not even started...

	* unix_tcp.c: read_passive_tcp_connection()
	    Report more info about WHO (host IP address) is trying
	    to contact us.

Wed Sep 21 17:53:59 1994  Gerald Hanusch (root@alijku65.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at)

	* io.c, protocol.c, recv_file.c:
	    "Be lenient on what you accept, strict on what you send"..
	    Accept always 7 streams, but send only N (1..7) depending
	    the system configuration.
	    [mea: Edited them to change literal '7' to 'MAX_STREAMS']

Mon Aug  8 10:02:29 1994  Gerald Hanusch (root@alijku65.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at)

	* gone_server.c: del_gone_user()
	    Fix the memory-freeup -- wrong memory block got freed..

Thu Jul  7 16:08:01 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* nmr.c: handle_nmr()
	    Rewrote parameter parsing for NMR forwarding.
	    A locally linked (ROUTE NNNN TO `LOCALNAME`) host
	    failed NMR delivery, and caused a SIGBUS error..
	    (Weird, isn't it..)

Tue Mar 15 01:25:38 1994  "Matti E. Aarnio"  (mea@oj287.astro.utu.fi)

	* unix_tcp.c, unix.c:
	    Added  setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &on, sizeof(on))
	    into local socket creation.  Might help on getting faster
	    restart..

	* unix_tcp.c:
	    Finished the Solarisation -- found a way to do "FIONBIO"
	    in SysVr4 style..

	* unix.c:
	    Cleaned up the code a bit by introducing local macroes
	    _FD_ZERO(), _FD_SET(), _FD_CLR(), _FD_ISSET()  which act
	    depending upon actual variant used.

Fri Mar 11 19:50:40 1994  "Matti E. Aarnio"  (mea@oj287.astro.utu.fi)

	* qrdr.c, sendfile.c, send.c, bmail.c, unix_tcp.c, main.c, unix.c,
	  libsendcmd.c, mailify.c, file_queue.c, detach.c, io.c, read_config.c,
	  acctcat.c, transfer.c, libhdrtbx.c, nmr_unix.c, unix_msgs.c,
	  unix_files.c, prototypes.h, recv_file.c, send_file.c, util.c,
	  libexpnhome.c, libndparse.c, sysexits.h:

	    Solarisation...  AARGH...

	    BSD-compat -library readdir() returns boguous data, but
	    plain socket()'s don't have FIONBIO :-(  Sample Makefile
	    definitions for Solaris are a result of LONG battle..
	    (Actually that was about wrong  #include -- must be <sys/dir.h>,
	     not <dirent.h> ...)


Thu Mar  3 12:56:21 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* sendfile.c:
	    Gerald found an odd behaviour of the system when
	    sendfile was invoked in an environment without
	    stdin...  Fixed fixed by not closing implicitely
	    defined "stdin" file (handle 0) AFTER an explicite
	    fopen had gotten a REAL fd=0 file a moment before..

Wed Feb 23 10:26:08 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* sendfile.c:
	    A couple of additional aliases:  sf (sendfile),  bitprt (print)
	    (By Gerald Hanusch)

	* send.c:
	    *Prompts* text from the user only when it is used
	    from the keyboard.  Usage from a pipe will not
	    put extra prompts on the stdout (in fact none.)

Tue Feb 22 12:58:50 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* unix_files.c:
	    More details on various phases of SYSIN handling.
	    (And other directory assignment rules.)

	    Also having full usage of SYSIN/PUNCH/PRINT/* -column,
	    and providing capability to match it.

Mon Feb 21 10:49:06 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* unix_files.c:
	    File delivery to non-pseudouser, non-realuser goes
	    to the POSTMAST for processing.

	* bintree.c, bmail.c, unix_msgs.c, main.c, transfer.c:
	    A set of changes from Gerald Hanusch to quiet down
	    compiler warnings.

	* send.c:
	    On "prompt mode" changed the instructions of
	    ending the session from "empty line" to "EOF".

Fri Feb 18 15:08:37 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* bintree.c, bintree.h -- reincarnation of heaptree.[ch]:
	    The HeapTree didn't work - not at all.
	    (Well, it was a PRIORITY QUEUE, not an ordered search tree)

	    Actually this is a kludge, which isn't even a balanced binary
	    tree, but one can search it with binary search.
	    (insert & delete are more expensive, though)

	* bmail.c:
	    Netdata "From:" became something mystic, and reception didn't
	    work at all.  Changed things so that ND-from is same as
	    NJE-From.


Thu Feb 17 10:00:14 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* transfer.c:
	    Option  -t  for transparent transfer, else the runner
	    of the transfer will appear as file originator..

	* consts.h, man-pages, funetnje.texinfo
	    Changed config filename to be  /etc/funetnje.cf

	* unix_route.c, njeroute.c, io.c, ucp.c, consts.h, clientutils.h:
	    Altered route-database to use `heaptree'.
	    Our knowledge says this database is fairly small.
	    (3000 entries of 19 bytes each, total circa 56k on a SPARC..)

	    Added command 'UCP RESCAN ROUTE', which actually will
	    re-open the route database.


Wed Feb 16 16:16:37 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* util.c parse_envelope():
	    Assign FID per 'FromUser', if it has value 0.
	    Assign OID per user '*NJE*', if it has value 0, AND there
	    is active flag `assign_oid'..

	    This will cause a more-VM/XA-like behaviour on spoolids.
	    Sender user's spoolids increment, when he sends a file,
	    and also when he receives a file.  Sender can have same
	    spoolided file in the reception spool, as this facility
	    assigns, but reception will always arrive on `not-previ-
	    ously-existing' spoolid.

	    It is a matter-of-taste, if `OID:'s should be assigned
	    and written into the spool file at the time of delivery
	    into local spool.  Now only the file-name indicates it.

	* heaptree.c, heaptree.h:
	    New in-core database with backing-store on disk.

	* unix_files.c, send_file.c, util.c, prototypes.h:
	    Use HeapTree-db to manage spoolids.

Mon Feb 14 12:53:58 1994  Gerald Hanusch (root@alijku65.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at)

	* sendfile.c, sendfile.1:
	    Added "-dist" -option.

Thu Feb 10 16:25:09 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* njeroutes.c (old name: unix_build.c), Makefile
	    Renamed the program.

	* prototypes.h:
	    Added some Convex Things into it.

Thu Feb 10 13:42:01 1994  Gerald Hanusch (root@alijku65.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at)

	* sendfile.c, recv_file.c, libreadcfg.c, bitsend.c, read_config.c:
	    Some small sanity-checks, and processing of configured
	    "DEFFORM".

Wed Feb  2 14:53:24 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* io.c init_link_state():
	    After possible active streams have been requeued,
	    all others are also requeued.

	* file_queue.c requeue_file_queue():
	   A version of  delete_file_queue()  which cleans the queue
	   and while doing it, requeues all files in it.
	   If it returns a value other than 0, it is used in wrong place!


Wed Feb  2 012:27:34 1994  Gerald Hanusch (root@alijku65.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at)

	* nmr.c send_nmr():
	    Removed old spurious NMRFMNOD reset to local (EBCDIC)
	    hostname.

Wed Feb  2 08:33:44 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* nmr.c handle_local_command():
	    Added local hard-coded commands 'MSG node user text..', and
	    'CMD node text..' to allow sending MSGs/CMDs "behind the corner"

	* unix_msgs.c, prototypes.h:
	    Allow incoming NMR text content to be modified.
	    Needed this for creating command aliases.

	* unix_msgs.c cmd_match():
	    Some more checks of scan termination, now it won't
	    match pattern  HELP  with token HELPP, and will
	    match  HELP  with  HELP ...

Tue Feb  1 16:18:44 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* unix_msgs.c:
	    More complex command pattern matching.
	    Result attributes  BUILTIN HARDCODED, and BUILTIN ERROR.

	* file_queue.c, unix_route.c, recv_file.c, prototypes.h:
	    Pulled back the multi-link queueing.

Mon Jan 31 08:53:51 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* nmr.c, unix_routes.c:
	    Found out a mysterious inactivity problem with ALIJKU65,
	    where Gerald Hanusch has thought that
			UCP ROUTE ALIJKU29 to DEFAULT
	    will send it via the default route..
	    Took several precautions on finding bogons from the route
	    batabase, if physical link exists, no problem.., and added
	    a way to delete explicite entry by using special targets
	    "OFF", and "DEFAULT".  Either one will do.


	* unix_msgs.c:
	    More thorough implementation of CMD-stuff. Especially allowing
	    running of arbitary programs.

	* ucp.c, io.c, consts.h, clientutils.h:
	    UCP RESCAN EXITS, UCP RESCAN QUEUE -commands.

	* file_queue.c add_to_file_queue():
	    Disabled (effectively) the  `altline' queueing code that
	    I tried to put in so that inplicite  debug_rescan_queue()
	    would not be needed.  We shall see later.


Fri Jan 28 15:31:00 1994  Gerald Hanusch (root@alijku65.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at)

	* util.c parse_envelope():
	    Default value for "To"-field was build with wrong
	    contents.  It was missing an @..

Fri Jan 28 16:51:00 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* unix_msgs.c:
	    More of NMR features.

	* protocol.c, io.c, main.c:
	    Link activation does implicite   debug_rescan_queue()
	    This *SHOULD* be done via some other mechanism, such
	    as parallel queueing into N links, but we shall see..

	* protocol.c, io.c, nmr.c, recv_file.c, file_queue.c, consts.h:
	    An attempt to codify a parallel queueing mechanism,
	    but stymied at the moment.  Decided to adopt Geralds
	    approach of link activation  debug_rescan_queue() as
	    an intermediate solution..

Thu Jan 27 08:58:19 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* unix_msgs.c  msg_run(), and others..:
	    Coded MSG RUN, added some logging and error reporting
	    in case msg-exit.cf (hujinje.cf:MSGEXITS) can't be
	    opened for analysis, etc.

	* util.c  despace():
	    Sometimes the despace() is called with a "string"
	    which is 0 size.  That is, it starts with NULL, and
	    in fact whole buffer is of NULLs..  (Especially
	    the SYSIN processing can do this.)

Tue Jan 25 09:06:18 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* unix_msgs.c:
	    The first cut on   msg-exit.cf  handling.  RUNNING something
	    is left for further job, but initial proof of concept for
	    the tests is now in there.

	* unix_msgs.c, unix_msgs.h:
	    New routine:  msg_register()  to dynamically bind
	    the NMR processors.

	* consts.h, unix.c, io.c, prototypes.h:
	    new "CMD":  CMD_MSG_REGISTER, which in turn
	    just calls   unix_msgs.c:msg_register()  with
	    the data.

Fri Jan 21 09:49:54 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* unix_tcp.c unix_tcp_receive():
	    Send ENQUIRE instead of SYN+NAK when in TCP_SYNC state.

	* file_queue.c

	* io.c, nmr.c:
	    A new command "Q SYS S" to show more details about
	    queue timings/buffer spaces.

Mon Jan 17 10:43:23 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* prototypes.h, util.c  parse_envelope():
	    A new parameter, and a new header entry to be processed:
	        OID: nnnn
	    If it is "0000", and caller (open_xmit_file()) has set
	    the "assign_oid"-flag, then do the assignment..
	  Related files:  send_file.c, unix.c, libhdrtbx.c, recv_file.c,
			  sendfile.c, bmail.c, protocol.c
	    Essentially the sender's spoolid is assigned just once
	    for the file - when it is opened for xmit. If stream
	    goes into a restart, same spoolid is used again.

	* ucp.c, io.c:
	    "DEBUG RESCAN -" which does not reinit the file queue
	    at all; only cleans up the in-core queue by dropping off
	    everything not actively being sent on the links.


Fri Jan 14 10:26:49 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* io.c init_link_state(), file_queue.c many routines:
	    Queue rip-up/duplicate check as prompted by
	    mr. Hanusch.
	    Aarnio's work contain hash_*() -routines to locate
	    any file from any queue -- assuming we know the
	    unique file hash value..

	* nmr.c  find_line_index():
	    Routes to  LOCAL  were not recognized.

Thu Jan 13 16:10:03 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* file_queue.c dequeue_line_queue():
	    Spurious brackets caused wrong action... None of the
	    active files were left alone..

Wed Jan 12 14:52:15 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* protocol.c, recv_file.c:
	    FileParam->OurFileId, and FileParam->FileId  usage
	    altered.  Now a new file gets its FID: when it is submitted,
	    and not again later, when it is put on xmit stream.
	    This uses spoolids also for locally delivered files,
	    which may, or may not be what user asks for.

	* unix_msgs.c:
	    Still more things to get the initial system perfomance
	    similar to state before massive rewrites.

	* unix_tcp.c:
	    Passive connection acceptance is difficult - eventually it
	    seems to work after a fashion, but causes sometimes extra
	    (and unnecessary) link restart.

	* sendfile.c:
	    Target address parsing is now more flexible.  First non '-'
	    beginning option is the target address (excluding option
	    parameters), and thus it need not be the first parameter.
	    Also local users can be defined w/o local host name.

	* send.c:
	    Now can do  "send localuser 'messsage text'" -command,
	    not always needing to write addresses in fully qualified
	    form...

Wed Jan 12 11:02:03 1993  Gerald Hanusch (root@alijku65.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at)

	* unix_msgs.c, nmr.c:
	    Missing things, and typographic mistakes rectified.

Wed Jan 12 00:29:52 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* consts.h:
	    Altered "VERSION" to be "3.1."

	* unix_msgs.c, unix_brdcst.c, nmr.c:
	    Massive rewriting to accomodate  message_exit().
	    Now the NMR processing really makes sense :-)
	    ... and now to test it..
	    Seems to work, then to implement the exits..

Tue Jan 11 09:10:29 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* sendfile.c, bmail.c:
	    ASCII header writing altered to conform that of the
	    incoming files -- that is, 512 bytes of ASCII in the
	    beginning.

	* util.c parse_envelope(), file_queue.c, unix.c:
	    If scanned envelope has "FID: 0000\n" in it, get
	    a new FID number from   send_file.c:get_send_fileid(),
	    and store it into the file.  It might not be unique
	    in the system, but it will sequence nicely..
	    (spool-file must be opened "r+")

	* unix_tcp.c read_passive_tcp_connection():
	    Yet another approach on handling the passive-side
	    activation..

	* protocol.c handle_ack():
	    When remote end wants to shut down, it starts rejecting
	    new streams. (or whatever reason there is to reject something)
	    Sender didn't spend its time on efficient data sending, rather
	    it went to use  handle_ack() every T_ACK, which was SLOW..
	    Rearranging   S_REFUSED  handling a bit, and adding some
	    new tests did increase its efficiency dramatically.

Tue Jan 11 08:20:40 1994  Gerald Hanusch (root@alijku65.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at)

	* protocol.c:
	    Rearranged queue handling calls inside protocol by
	    moving  dequeue_file_entry(), and delete_file() from
	    complete_rcb() into handle_ack().

Mon Jan 10 08:52:40 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* io.c:
	    When gets  UCP SHUT, or UCP SHUT ABORT, closes immediately
	    the passive end, and then signs off links.  That way the
	    other ends won't cause link-restarts all the time..

	* unix_tcp.c  send_unix_tcp():
	    Do  select-for-write  and timeout via that method..
	    Also uses microsecond accurate (well,  struct timeval)
	    timing.  Should work faster on Linux..

	* prototypes.h, util.c:
	    NEW: timevaladd(), timevalsub() -- time arithmetic routines.

	* file_queue.c dequeue_file_entry(), io.c init_link_state():
	    dequeue_file_entry() relies on   CurrentStream -variable,
	    made sure it is set properly when calling it.
	    Now queueing works :)

	* protocol.c, prototypes.h, send_file.c:
	    Some rearrangements of   send_njh_dsh_data()  usage.

Mon Jan 10 08:52:40 1994  Gerald Hanusch (root@alijku65.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at)

	* protocol.c  handle_text_block():
	    Rearranged stream EOF acknowledgement code to be more robust.

Fri Jan  7 10:41:11 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* prototypes.h:
	    Added long missing entries for a couple routines in
	    file_queue.c

	* rscsacct.c, protocol.c:
	    Moved sending account collection into S_NJT_SENT state.
	    (Old was S_EOF_SENT, but it was called rarely.. it seems..)


Thu Jan  6 15:10:51 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* unix_tcp.c  unix_tcp_receive():
	    "Skulldruggery..."  Aargh..
	    Yes, some elementary errors can be of most difficult to
	    understand, and to find out.   RecvSize was able to go
	    negative, and thus screw up the buffer management logic..

Wed Jan  5 12:46:47 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* unix_tcp.c  unix_tcp_receive():
	    Still more joggling with   TTB  processing, is it
	    correct now ?

Tue Jan  4 08:52:07 1994  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* libsendcmd.c, unix.c, unix_tcp.c:
	    Found out about spurious   htonl() on returning results
	    of inet_addr() to network-order s_addr -fields..
	    On SPARC system the  hton*(), and ntoh*() are no-ops,
	    on 386'es they are not...


Fri Dec 24 02:25:35 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* unix_tcp.c, unix.c:
	    Hunted out why  unix_tcp.c:unix_tcp_receive()
	    didn't process all arrived bytes at once.
	    Things have improved - I hope.
	    (io.c:  Q SYS  output has temporarily a display of
	                   in, and outbound buffer ages & sizes.)

	* protocol.c:
	    Changed all logger() calls before  restart_channel()
	    to be of level 1.

Thu Dec 23 11:49:18 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* protocol.c, io.c, file_queue.c, unix_tcp.c:
	    Reorganized file queue routines into one file.
	    Located common link state ripup routines into
	       IO.C:init_link_state().
	    Made sure there is a preceeding logger() message
	    (at least on level 2) before  restart_channel()
	    is called.


Tue Dec 21 11:11:34 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* unix_tcp.c:
	    Rewrote the  setsockopt() usage. Model from BSD net2 rmt
	    program.

Mon Dec 20 00:04:22 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* unix_tcp.c:
	    Teached new trick:  setsockopt()  sets TCP level buffers
	    to be 32k, with hope of not needing any fancy NBSTREAM
	    bufferings..

	* main.c:
	    Make sure the PID_FILE has protection 0644 -- so, it is globally
	    readable..

	* protocol.c, io.c, file_queue.c:
	    Tracked queue accounting, maybe it now will
	    not loose files from its queues.


Sun Dec 19 02:01:36 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* unix_tcp.c send_unix_tcp():
	    A non-blocking read()+write() so that system won't
	    deadlock in case of kernel tcp-buffer filling, and
	    local process waiting on write() that the other end
	    read()s, while it is waiting on write(), that we
	    read()...

	    Code makes an serious assumtion:
	       8kB gets transmitted in under 15 seconds
	       time of waiting on this module!

	    On systems with in-kernel TCP buf-sizes being 16k, or
	    more this is no problem.  On systems with SMALLER
	    buffers it may well be, as that time is spent in
	    synchronous mode waiting the receiver to act upon
	    the data..

	    One possibility is to do:
		setsockopt(fd,TCP,SO_RCVBUF,&var32k,sizeof(var32k)),
		setsockopt(fd,TCP,SO_SNDBUF,&var32k,sizeof(var32k)),
	    but will it work on all systems ?

Wed Dec 15 08:35:10 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* protocol.c, unix_tcp.c, io.c
	    Trying to eradict occasional spurious write() hangups..

	* unix_files.c:
	    Report message of Act_DISCARD is changed to a more informative
	    one.

	* protocol.c, read_config.c, consts.h:
	    A new stream-interleave mode:  F_SLOW_INTERLEAVE

	* recv_file.c save_header():
	    Still had some wrong buffer-references inside  sizeof()s..

	* consts.h:
	    Got rid of `GuardBuffer' from inside the link data structure.
	    (Relict from a couple days earlier for debugging the stream
	     overflows / ActiveStreams -flags problems.)

	* protocol.c:
	    An attempt to have SHUTDOWN to really shut down,
	    and not to complain about SIGNOFF ACKs..

Tue Dec 14 13:05:21 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* recv_file.c:
	    When reporting a failure of "Missing JOB HEADER", `just'
	    abort_file(), don't restart the whole link..

	* protocol.c:
	    Do a fast (at every record) stream switch-over at the
	    S_SENDING_FILE phase so that N streams will go out at
	    approximately same speed.

Mon Dec 13 11:09:43 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* protocol.c:
	    Link restart will need to zero ActiveStreams -flags.
	    It will also need to free non-held streams.

	    With REQUEST_RCB an open of bad stream (receiver has 2
	    streams enabled, and sender has 3, 3rd stream open
	    (parallel)) will cause a REJECT_RCB to be generated,
	    and stream shunted immediately.

	* unix.c  handle_alarm():
	    Rearm the  SIGALRM  handler... (SYSV/Posix)


Sat Dec 11 00:55:26 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* unix_tcp.c:
	    More carefull approach at timer queueing..
	    when read() returned due to EINTR, no read was queued,
	    and link collapsed..

Fri Dec 10 11:10:50 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* unix.c, protocol.c:
	    Got rid of  OrigFileName's  in favor of  SpoolFileName..

	* version.sh (NEW) (version.c), main.c, consts.h, io.c, Makefile:
	    Generate automatically updated date/time stamp on the
	    distribution file set, and report it in  Q SYS/Q STAT

Thu Dec  9 01:03:33 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* unix_tcp.c unix_tcp_receive(), io.c:
	    struct TTR, and struct TTB usage finetuned,
	    did it lick the memory copy errors ?

Wed Dec  8 09:48:58 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* mailify.c:
	    Finally "the first cut" version.
	    Can be used with Zmailer mail_open()/mail_abort()/mail_close()
	    library (-DUSE_ZMAILER), as well as with  /usr/lib/sendmail

	    Processing of other than BSMTP is lacking as of yet.

	* libstrsave.c:  NEW
	    NEW:  strsave() which mallocs space for a string, copies it in,
	          and returns the pointer.

	* libreceive.c, receive.c, mailify.c:
	    libreceive's dump_*line() get now a (struct ndparam *),
	    instead of (FILE *) to the output file, and process
	    accordingly with possible  ndp->outproc(), if defined..

	* bmail.c:
	    BSMTP punch of 80+ chars ling lines needs a VERY CAREFULL
	    handling of `.'s...

Tue Dec  7 14:44:11 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* sendfile.c, receive.c:
	    Minor tweaks to please Sun bundled CC (and any other K&R compiler)

	* send_file.c:
	    NDHGXWTR variable shall be set only for non-print formats,
	    for prints it shall be XL8'00'...


Thu Dec  2 14:17:50 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* nmr.c find_line_index():
	    Logics rewrite, no more recursive call to itself to figure out
	    where to route the file..  Tests are:
	      - Local hostname, its alias, or "LOCAL" ? -> annouce so
	      - to some active link ?  -> announce so
	      - via route database to some active link ? -> announce so
	      - to some inactive link ? -> announce so
	      -> report failure

	* ucp.c, ygone.c:
	    Call arguments of  send_cmd_msg()  had a problem...
	    ... as these are interactive tools, they should report
	    an error, when the main-program is not online.  The 3rd
	    argument is a flag of that effect, and it had wrong value.

Wed Dec  1 08:49:54 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* consts.h, unix_tcp.c, io.c:
	    Renamed input `buffer' to be `InBuffer' on the link structure.
	    (As for output there is  XmitBuffer) -- must check that under
	    no circumstances shall it ever be written outside that buffer!

	* util.c  parse_envelope():
	    Added size-limits on several copy-operators (in fact ALL of
	    them) so that they will never overwrite anything trailing
	    their respective buffer variables.

	    Nevertheless, handling of  LINE->buffer  seems also suspicuous..
	    On the other hand...  It feels a lot like some intrrupt-routine
	    would screw the memory references..

	* protocol.c, nmr.c:
	    Some  (struct MESSAGE)  related pointer cleanups, but suspect
	    the real cause of core-drops be in util.c, as variables AFTER
	    last OutFileParam get somewhat written over..

Fri Nov 26 14:16:26 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* logger.c logger():
	    Rewrote logger() to be <varargs.h> routine..

	* unix_files.c inform_filearrival():
	    Reordering argument expansion into subprogram caused
	    used pointer to be undefined, and contain junk..
	    logger() caused core-drop when it was used..

	* send_file.c  send_njh_dsh_record():
	    Make JobName to contain same numeric value, as does
	    the FileId word..

Thu Nov 25 10:04:12 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* unix.c handle_sig*():
	    All but SIGTERM need to be re-instantiated on SYSV machines,
	    and it doesn't hurt the BSD style signals either..

Mon Nov 22 09:58:33 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* mailify.c:
	    Started coding it, didn't finish yet, though..

	* unix_files.c, man/hujinje.8:
	    Added argument tag $$, which is like its name-sake in
	    shells.  For things like:  /tmp/rcv.$$ -> /tmp/rcv.14323

	* libndfuncs.c:
	    Had a missing upperstr() when creating  INMDSNAM text unit.
	    In the end the VM/SP CMS receive didn't like it..

	* io.c, send.c:
	    Have `send' command capable to send a `system' messages.
	    So, messages w/o username at all.

	* unix_tcp.c:
	    If a pending-connect is in progress, DON'T ACCEPT passive open!

	* nmr.c, unix_brcst.c:
	    Collected \r\n....\r(\n) all into same place: unix_brcst.c,
	    and thus hopefully got local and remote messages to have
	    somewhat more uniform outlook.

	* man/hujinje.8, unix_files.c:
	    Added exit variable $FID

	* Makefile
	    Do `install' on `receive' also.

Tue Nov 16 15:01:32 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* prototypes.h:
	    Added  tolower(), and  toupper()

	* Updated man-pages, but didn't finish them yet..

Mon Nov 15 11:09:35 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* read_config.c:
	    Have an alias of  USEREXITS  keyword, which is intended to
	    take over it (and is now in the documents..):  FILEEXITS

	* ndlib.h, libndparse.c:
	    If the file is MVS TSO dataset with a MEMBR info, parse
	    its name to be:  FILENAME.FILETYPE.MEMBR, else parse
	    its name to be:  FILENAME.FILETYPE

	* receive.c:
	    The argument is at first assumed to be full (well, adequate)
	    path to a file, if it fails, it is assumed to be a filename
	    in the default spool directory.  If it fails still, it is
	    assumed to be numeric, and if it turns out to be an integer
	    in range of 1..9900, it is formatted with "%04d" -format,
	    and open attempt is directed there.

	* receive.c:
	    Non-netdata reception had problems after output file
	    open rearrangements.  Now used  defaultoutname[], if
	    the user has not specified anything.

	* libndparse.c:
	    More carefull handling of  INMFTIME, and INMCREAT output
	    strings.

	* ndlib.h, receive.c, ndparse.c:
	    Changes in common used datastructures, to minimize compiler
	    warnings about 'const' property being discarded.

	* bitsend.c, bitreceive.c:
	    First attemptes since 1990 to update them.
	    Wow!  Did I have that kind of ideas about user readers ??
	    (~/.bitspool/ for every user..)

Sun Nov 14 18:16:44 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* receive.c:
	    Will restore original (netdata) file date from  INMCREAT,
	    else tries to use INMFTIME.

	* libndfuncs.c:
	    Will create INMCREAT text unit into outgoing ND file with
	    file creation timestamp in it (well, last modification..)
	    IFF THE infile IS A REGULAR DISK FILE -- Pipes etc will
	    not contain INMCREAT timestamp in them..

	* bmail.c:
	    Implemented  -u -option, which my mailer had assumed for ages..
	    (And had to manually re-generate 180 or so files..)

	* file_queue.c:
	    When it complains about lack of `@' in file, rename
	    that file with RN_JUNK.. and tell the new file-name
	    in the log..

	* sendfile.c:
	    ND-things are now in  ndlib.h, not in clientutils.h..

	* receive.c, ndlib.h, libndparse.c, ndparse.c:
	    Altered NETDATA PARSER call sequence -- now it passes
	    pointer to a fairly large struct with various modalities.

	* qrdr.c:
	    Altered the output structure.  No more of original FID, we
	    are interested in of our own SpoolIDs..

Fri Nov 12 14:13:16 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* receive.c:
	    Teached  SPOOLID (receiver's own)  usage.
	    Improved (A lot!) debug output of NJH, DSH, and NJT.

	* libndparse.c, clientutils.h ndparse.c, receive.c:
	    Changed ND-parser calling convention.  Now it
	    can figure out the output filename from ND data.
	    (Unless user defined something explicite.)

Fri Nov 12 08:31:12 1993  Gerald Hanusch (root@alijku65.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at)

	* unix_route.c:
	    Corrected  DefaultRoute  usage.

Thu Nov 11 08:48:20 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* nmr.c:
	    Don't know, if  (NMRTYPE & 0x04) == 0  really means
	    there is some timestamp in the message record.
	    It looks like there is no such thing at all.

	* qrdr.c:
	    Recognize `.spoolid', and don't look at it at all.

	* unix_files.c  RenameToUniqueFileid():
	    Have `.spoolid' -file in every receiver directory,
	    and place files to be  0001, 0002, ... 9900, and
	    wrap around.  If there are A LOT of files in receiver
	    directory, it may take some time to do it thru, though..
	    As a fall-back, older scheme of  A<hextime>X -names
	    is used, but only when there are 9900 files in one
	    directory (which means the recipient in in great
	    trouble anyway..)

Wed Nov 10 09:52:39 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* libsendcmd.c:
	    Have some effect on the `offlineok' flag too...

	* recv_file.c finish_file():
	    Altered the structure of finish_file(), which now will
	    rename_file(..,RN_HOLD_ABORT,..) a file which is found
	    not to be routable, all else are renamed  RN_NORMAL.

	* nmr.c handle_NMR():
	    Had excessively difficult comparison routine, cleaned it,
	    and some unused variables...

	* send_file.c get_send_fileid(), protocol.c open_xmit_file():
	    Pick a new spoolid for local sending, and use it as
	    originator spoolid, if user has not set anything in
	    advance.. (default set by  bmail, and  sendfile  is 0.)

	* util.c despace():
	    Damn difficult..  Finally fixed it.

Tue Nov  9 10:21:13 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* util.c, recv_file.c, nmr.c, unix_tcp.c, unix_brcst.c  despace():
	    NEW routine -- scattered all around was code to do similar
	    (or same) function.  Made it a sort of internal library module.


Sat Nov  6 10:22:24 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* read_config.c, io.c, protocol.c, consts.h:
	    Retry periods configurable backoff.
	    Configuring it is missing, but default is
	    in there... (1, 2, 5, 15, 15, 15.. minutes)

	* unix.c  timer_*():
	    Timeout at clocktime X, not in so many calls to the
	    timer_ast()..  Latter depends upon the speed of
	    the timeout on the poll_socket() routine.

	* recv_file.c, send_file.c:
	    RSCS and General section LENGTH_4 calculation & checkup
	    retuned.  Now produces (and receives) files as the IBM
	    does..

	* consts.h, unix.c, file_queue.c  rename_file():
	    New rename_file() flag: RN_JUNK.
	    Use this routine for all renames.. (Well, local
	    delivery by  unix_files.c  is a different thing..)

	* util.c, file_queue.c  parse_envelope():
	    Cleanup of envelope preliminary data initializations.
	    Placed all that we can into parse_envelope() itself.

	* libsubmit.c:
	    FileSize treatment fix..  I was wondering, why freshly
	    submitted 800 byte file claimed to be 400k...

	* file_queue.c, io.c, nmr.c  show_files_queue():
	    Show at most 30 files on a link, if somebody
	    asks it via CMD  Q linkname Q
	    For  UCP SHOW QUEUE  show at most 1000 queued items.

	* file_queue.c, unix.c
	  init_files_queue(), poll_sockets(), parse_file_queue():
	    If at all possible, fork a child-process and read a list
	    of files from special pipe(2) created for IPC.
	    (System will work, even if it can't fork()..  Although
	     at such situation the things are bad indeed..)

	* unix.c  writen(), readn():
	    Corrected return values.

	* recv_file.c:
	    Noticed the lack of incoming records counter.
	    Also reorganized (ASCII) TAG rewriting.
	    (Now incoming files get record count logged properly.)

	* rscsacct.c
	    Fixed bad time-string generation.
	    (Seconds were lacking from it..)

	* acctcat.c: (NEW)
	    Simple tool to output RSCSACCT data, and thus verify it.
	    ... found some bugs..

	* recv_file.c  parse_headers():
	    Found one file from NETSERV which had different size of
	    DSH General Section, than the expected one, therefore
	    DSH RSCS section was offset, and the real file name
	    was not found, and thus NETINIT processor didn't know
	    what to do with the file it got...

Fri Nov  5 08:11:43 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* sendfile.c
	    Usage partially rewritten (mostly ok..)

	* libetbl.c, libebc2asc.c, libasc2ebc.c, bmail.c, send.c, sendfile.c,
	  bitcat.c, ndparse.c, receive.c, main.c, hujinje.8, bmail.8,
	  ebcdictbl.5, send.1, bitcat.1, ndparse.1, sendfile.1:
	    Implemented user-definable EBCDIC<->ASCII tables.
	    Environment variable:  EBCDICTBL, and explicite keyword
	    on   /etc/hujinje.cf.   Environment overrides the keyword.

	* consts.h, main.c, unix.c, read_config.c, protocol.c, recv_file.c,
	  hujinje.8:
	    Integrate RSCSACCT in.

	* consts.h, io.c, main.c, unix.c:
	    Have cumulative statistics as well as periodic ones..

Thu Nov  4 10:30:36 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* rscsacct.c:  NEW!
	    RSCSv1 style account records (in EBCDIC of course).
	    Need still a new config parameter for defining the log
	    file, and calls of  rscsacct_log()  to use it..

	* headers.h:  (documenting)
	    Added some comments on various FLAG values in the NJE headers.

	* file-exit.cf, unix_files.c, hujinje.8:
	    Altered order of parameters, and made old MAILIFY, et.al.
	    to be just RUN and program path + args..

	* recv_file.c:
	    Yet more logics changes to implement more VM/SP like behaviour.
	    Detects if NJE DSH does not have RSCS section in it, and then
	    won't go boinkers due to a lack of data..

	* send_file.c, util.c, consts.h, bitspool.5:
	    Build NJH  PRT and PUN  directions (optionally) explicitely.
	    Default value comes from "FRM:" ASCII header.

	* nmr.c, protocol.c:
	    Hunting mysterious error on NMR queue "->next" value
	    corruption.

Wed Nov  3 09:09:28 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* transfer.c:
	    Changed argument order, and moves to BITNET QUEUE directory..

	* unix_files.c inform_filearrival(),  hujinje.8:
	    Implemented fork processing macro expansions..

	* bmail.c, bitsend.c, ygone.c, send.c, receive.c:
	    Removed unnecessary  #include "headers.h"

Wed Nov  3 08:55:16 1993  Gerald Hanusch (root@alijku65.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at)

	* receive.c:
	    Finishing touches here & there

	* unix_files.c inform_filearrival():
	    When having arguments on executable program, place them on
	    correct  ARGV[]  indexes..

	* nmr.c list_users(); CPQ U/N -commands
	    Corrected user counting especially on Linux, but problem was
	    somewhat generic.

Tue Nov  2 15:52:13 1993  Gerald Hanusch (root@alijku65.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at)

	* receive.c:
	    Finished the first write-thru.  Matti didn't have time
	    for it.

Sat Oct 30 03:52:17 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* receive.c: 
	    NEW: A combination of  ndparse,  and bitcat.
	    Initial version, which eventually will include
	    also the  mailify,  and then removes separate
	    modules handling various formats at present.

	* unix_files.c, hujinje.8:
	    Radical changes on FILE-EXIT.CF parsing, and handling.
	    File exit syntax changed, keywords changed, ...
	    Yet to be introduced are various $TOUSER, $TONODE, et.al.
	    argument macroes.

Fri Oct 29 08:54:56 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* Makefile:
	    In the  clientlib.a, depend of the internal modules only only.

	* libndparse.c:
	    Name change, was: netdata-parse.c

	* libndfuncs.c:
	    We generated bad INMDSNAM, when there was no FT defined..

	* prototypes.h:
	    Some finetunings of various declarations.

	* unix_brdcst.c:
	    Added some alarm()'s

	* nmr.c:
	    CPQ U, CPQ N listings look a lot different now..

	* unix.c writen():
	    Add  alarm(3)  usage into the writen().  Makes sure we
	    won't stuck on it forever (I HOPE there will be EINTR
	    exit from the write()..)

	* bitsend.c, bmail.c, detach.c, libreadcfg.c, libsendcmd.c,
	  main.c, unix.c, unix_tcp.c

	    Linux patches by Gerald Hanusch

Wed Oct 27 13:31:44 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* netdata-parse.c  get_text_unit():
	    NETDATA key INMDSNAM (X'0002') CAN have 0 size text
	    value units.  (Such was on one MVS output..)
	    **** Turned out to be our own libndfunc bug.. ****

	* sendfile.c, recv_file.c, libhdrtbx.c, bitspool.5:
	    Gerald Hanusch: Changed (somewhat) usage of  "TYP:" header
			    entry.  "PRINT is PRINT even with ASA.."
			    Also there is no more of such a type as "MAIL"..
			    Only used ones are: PUNCH, PRINT, and JOB

	* bitcat.c:
	    Matti Aarnio:   Extended debug dumping of NJH,DSH, and NJT records.
	    Gerald Hanusch: ASA processing changes

	* consts.h, send_file.c, protocol.c:
	    Changed names of the constants to be feed to
	    send_njh_dsh_record() by prefixing them with  "SEND_".

Tue Oct 26 08:10:29 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@ftp.funet.fi)

	* send_file.c send_njh_dsh_record():
	    If the  "TAG:" is empty (blank), don't fill it in the
	    DSH either, nor send it at all!

	* main.c:
		signal(SIGCLD,SIG_IGN);  on Linux system.
	    waitpid() does not look too successfull, and actually we are
	    not that interested of return codes...

	* io.c, unix_tcp.c, unix.c, consts.h:
			"-DNBSTREAM instead of -DNBCONNECT"
	    Attempt to create a non-blocking write, but first edition was
	    not successfull...

	* qrdr.c:
	    Add a missing check of content SRCBs 0xA0, and 0xB0 (there were
	    0x80, and 0x90 in place..)

Mon Oct 25 10:16:01 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* unix.c, unix_tcp.c:
	    writen() -- An attempt to make sure all gets written out, but
	                got a situation where it seem to generate a deadlock..

	* nmr.c find_line_index():
	    When claiming  LINK_INACTIVE,  make sure also telling what
	    name of the link it was..

	* file_queue.c queue_file():
	    Use claimed link-name to figure out where to put the queued
	    file, when the link is inactive..

Fri Oct 22 10:13:05 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* nmr.c list_users():
	    Proper usage of  utmp  data.  There were difficulties at
	    handling (listing) users with 8 characters long names..
	    Also shows if the terminal is on "mesg n" status, or not.

	* recv_file.c parse_headers():
	    More parsing and processing of incoming NJE headers to make
	    it behave even more like VM/SP

	* net_routes.8:
	    Documented route definitions, especially alternate
	    routes.

Thu Oct 21 08:59:50 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* util.c parse_envelope():
	    Bad buffer length parameter for  fgets().  Now it can
	    handle transit files.

	* nmr.c, unix_route.c:  routing things..
	    Now uses a database of "struct ROUTE_RECORD" in all modules.
	    Also other changes into routing logic.

	* unix_tcp.c:
	    Changed some error messages.
	    Connection creation did never store NAK reason code into
	    outbound NAK..

	* unix.c: poll_sockets()
	    Improved (?) connection acceptance by removing a possible
	    window where it was possible to have incoming connection
	    accepted, and before resulting  PassiveReadChannel  became
	    processed, ANOTHER accept was possible to happen..
	    Now will do accepts only after previous link login is done.
	    (CHECK: if there happens a timeout, what eventually happens ?)

Wed Oct 20 09:58:34 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* bitcat.c, sendfile.c, recv_file.c, unix.c, clientutils.h,
	  libsendcmd.c:
	    Back-ported the source to  K&R CC, specifically  SunOS 4.1.3 cc

	* sendfile.c, libndfuncs.c, libdondata.c:
	    Do better composition of NETDATA -- use VARYING size records,
	    not shortened VSB.  Also  -fix  option affects this by defining
	    output to be FIXED records.

	* netdata-parse.c:
	    More concise debug output, shows symbolic names on keys, and
	    some data.

Tue Oct 19 01:12:29 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* libdondata.c, libndfuncs.c, clientlibs.h:
	    Added `askack' option into INMR01 generation.

	* nmr.c: list_users()
	    Gerald Hanusch:  Proper version of  CPQ U <username>
			     command behaviour.

	* netdata-parse.c:
	    Major rewrite so that it understands segmented
	    netdata records.  Now handles several esoteric
	    input files which until now have been impossible..

Mon Oct 18 14:05:12 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* recv_file.c: parse_headers()
	    Teach some more manners for the incoming envelope parsing
	    (By Gerald Hanusch) -- MVS TSO is pecular kind of system.

	* main.c: bug_check()
	    Inform users also!

Sun Oct 17 22:58:20 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* file_queue.c: queue_file()
	    Added a debug tracer, which turned out to be unnecessary.
	    Earlier fix to   nmr.c:find_line_index()  was correct.

Sat Oct 16 03:10:09 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* Many modules:
	    Use  lowerstr(), upperstr()  routines instead of open
	    coded non-unsigned comparisons.  Also changed calls to
	    compare() to be  strcasecmp(), or where appropriate
	    strcmp().

	* nmr.c: find_line_index()
	    Figured out why the route finding didn't work properly..

	* unix_route.c:
	    Corrected  NDBM routine call arguments.

Fri Oct 15 13:29:32 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* main.c:
	    Complain about other running HUJINJE program before reading
	    in configurations, or anything such.

	* recv_file.c save_headers(), parse_headers():
	    Null the header buffers before saving into them.
	    Parse the TAG: data from DSH header only if the 
	    DSH has sufficient size, and thus contains it...

	* unix.c, unix_tcp.c, consts.h, Makefile: (multiple modules)
	    A NON-BLOCKING connect(2)

	    Essentially an observation that stream can be ioctl(2)ed into
	    FIONBIO before connect(2), and then the connect(2) will return
	    error EINPROGRESS meaning the attempt is initiated, and will
	    take a moment to complete.  Select(2) can be used to see, if
	    stream's state has reached a 'ready to run', or 'failed' state.
	    If later, treat it as connect(2) failure.
	    (It was all in the connect(2) man page..  Just carefull reading..)
	    
Wed Oct 13 02:01:44 1993  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)

	* recv_file.c save_headers():
	    Make sure we save only as much as we have buffers for.
	    Don't wonder about multiple DSH's -- MVSes send them anyway..

	* bitcat.c:
	    Reworked print-file outputs.  Again "one-off"..

	* libreadcfg.c:
	    Modified the   file-exit   parsing somewhat thus fixing
	    problems with wrong defaults creeping to system users
	    who don't have things in same places as I do.. (spool dirs)

	* Nearly all modules:
	    Had a closer look at what is needed in each module,
	    and what is not.  Got rid of many `#include "headers.h"'
	    that way..  Also updated dependencies in the Makefile.

	    And also did "my style" (mostly Emacs') C-indentations
	    to the source modules.

	* Created  ChangeLog

(in history -- 1990..1993)  Matti Aarnio  (mea@nic.funet.fi)


	* Received original HUJI-NJE, and started modifying it.
	  - Original system is a `do it all' module, which
	    does file reception on behalf of the user, etc.
	    That may be the only way in the VMS (I doubt as
	    JNET has spools too..) but it definitely isn't
	    very good in UNIX, thus:

	* Ported the beast into strict-alignment RISC processors
	  (=Sun SPARC) by rewriting some CISC code which paid
	  no attention on how to do things right..  ANSI-C warned
	  that pointers to anything but chars (and void*) can have
	  expected alignment of target datatype, and thus misaligned
	  referral thru them won't work..

	* Separated transport, and file postprocessing in case
	  of local recipient.

	  Rewrote all modules to some extend, but then:
	  Rewrote following modules completely:
	    - recv_file.c
	    - send_file.c
	    - bmail.c
	    - sendfile.c
	    - main.c
	  Wrote new modules:
	    - Makefile
	    - detach.c (took from elsewere)
	    - unix_files.c
	    - bitcat.c
	    - bitsend.c
	    - client library parts (by collecting them from all over
	    			    the system into single fileset)
	    - unix_files.c
	    - logger.c
	    - ndparse.c
	    - netdata-parse.c
	    - qrdr.c

	* Implemented dual spool system: (configurable)
		/usr/spool/bitnet/LINKNAME/   - for transmission links
		/usr/spool/bitspool/USERNAME/ - for local users

	* Wrote UNIX man-pages of the system

	* Implemented a bunch of tools for post-processing files,
	  also file sending tools.  After all, netdata processing
	  et.al. are entirely of users responsiblity.

	* Implemented an exit mechanism to generalize incoming file
	  handling -- like `MAILER', which now can accept NETDATA BSMTP.

	* Implemented 3 (and half) selectable (via Pre-processor symbols
	  in the Makefile) inter-process-communication methods, and added
	  some resemblance of security into them.

	* Implemented SYSIN file generation and reception.

	* Made spool files to be local host byte-order independent
	  (uwrite()/uread() in utils.c, Uread()/Uwrite() in client lib.)
	  and thus now can share this spool in mixed hosts via NFS, if
	  so desired.

	* Fixed IP address parsing and DNS usages so that addresses do work
	  now.

	* This system generates TAGfull data always, even when no TAG
	  is really defined.  TAGs generate larger DSH blocks, so large
	  in fact that they must get fragmented.

	* Accept queued spool file names to reside under the `QUEUE'
	  directory (defined in hujinje.cf -file) only.  Also forget
	  files whose name starts with a period.

	* Four facettes for  sendfile.c  program:
	     sendfile	sends NETDATA
	     punch	punches 80 char records
	     print	prints 132 char records
	     submit	sends 80 char records in SYSIN format

	* Made NETDATA generation into a library module, and
	  use that one to implement both the  sendfile, and  bmail's
	  NETDATA abilities.

	* Traded ASCII<->EBCDIC translation macroes into
	  utility library modules.

	* Cleaned memcpy() usage, and other alignment issues.

	* Corrected IBM-time to UNIX-time conversion.

	* Made spool files to be host byte-order independent.
	  In practice: Spool files can now be copied over from one
	  machine to any other via whatever means.

	* Made passive connection initiation happen again, and
	  again, until it is done successfully.   Does it every
	  minute or so, not every second..
